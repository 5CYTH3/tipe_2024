\section{Abstract}
This article is a consequence of me doing some researches about the compilation process steps, when I suddenly stumbled across a visualization of the Hindley-Milner type inference algorithm, which ressenbles the way bottom-up parsers parse context-free grammars.
This is when I got the idea of combining parsing and type inference, and then formalize the process in this article.
This article is divided in three steps. The first one aims to present a Proof Of Concept of a working parser-type inferrer on a context-free lisp-like grammar, using a \acrlong{rdp} and \acrlong{hm} type inference algorithm. The second part then tries to formalize to preceding section and lastly the third part tries to prove/address which grammars can use this system.
